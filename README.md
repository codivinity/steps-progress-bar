# steps-progress-bar
The "steps-progress-bar" repository is a project that implements a step-by-step progress bar or wizard interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly solution for guiding users through a multi-step process or workflow.

The HTML code provided represents the structure of the wizard interface. It comprises a container element containing a main section with a title and description. The steps are presented as a list, with each step item consisting of a circle icon and a corresponding step text. The appearance of the step items can vary to indicate their status, such as using the "step-success" class for completed steps and "step-error" class for steps with errors. Additionally, there is a final step that does not possess a specific status.

The interface also includes "Back" and "Next" buttons, enabling users to navigate between the steps of the wizard and control their progression through the process.

The CSS file referenced in the HTML (style.css) is utilized to define the visual appearance and layout of the wizard elements. It allows customization and styling of the step circles, text, buttons, and overall design.

The JavaScript file (script.js) is responsible for adding interactivity and functionality to the wizard. It handles button clicks, updates the progress based on user actions, and performs any necessary tasks or validations during the step transitions.

By studying and utilizing this project, you can learn how to create a similar step-by-step progress bar or wizard interface for your own web applications. It provides insights into the HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic required to implement a user-friendly and intuitive multi-step process, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.
